Q.NO.01
Length and breadth of a rectangle are 5 and 7 respectively. Write a program to calculate the area of the rectangle.
Formula (area = length * breadth)

void main() {
  int length =5;
  int breadth = 7;
  int area= length*breadth;
  print("The Area Of Rectangle Is " "$area");
}


Q.NO.02)
Create a integer variable num = 7, Add 8 to the number and then divide it by 3. 
Now, the modulus of that number is taken with 5 and then multiply the resultant value by 5, 
store result in variable i. Display the final result.

void main() {
  var num =7;
  var num1=num+8;
  var num2=num1/3;
  var num3=num2%5;
  var num4=num3*5;
  var i=num4;
  print (i);
}

Q.NO.03
Write a program create two integer variables 'a' and 'b' and assign them any number and then check if both the conditions 'a < 50' and 'a < b' are true.
Display the result, now check if at-least one of the conditions 'a < 50' and 'a < b' is true

void main(){
  int a = 30;
  int b = 60;
  
 print(a<50 && a<b);
 print(a<50|| a<b);
}

Q.NO.04
If the marks of Robert in three subjects are 78,45 and 62 respectively (each out of 100 ),
write a program to calculate his total marks and percentage marks. Print his name, marks of all three subjects
total marks and percentage.
void main() {

var name = "Robert";
print (name);
 int eng =78;
 int urdu = 45;
 int math = 62;
 int totalmarks=100;
 int obtainmarks=(eng +urdu+math);
print("Obtain Marks is ""$obtainmarks");
print("Total Marks is" "$totalmarks");
double per = totalmarks/obtainmarks*100;
print ("Percentage is " "$per");
}
}
